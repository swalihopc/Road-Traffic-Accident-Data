Goal of the Data

Analyse road traffic accident data to reduce the frequency and severoty of accidents. Develop insights to improve road safety measures and traffic management systems.

Descripton of Dataset

The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accident of the year 2017-20. All the sensitive information have been excluded during data encoding and finally it has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident. Then it is preprocessed and for identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms algorithms. RTA Dataset.csv is the dataset before preprocessing and cleaned.csv is the preprocessed dataset.

About the Data:

The target feature is Accident_severity which is a multi-class variable. The task is to classify this variable based on the other 31 features step-by-step by going through rach days task.Your metric for evaluation will be f1-score
